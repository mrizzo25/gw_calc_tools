# gw_calc_tools
A set of functions to calculate relevant quantities in binary systems which produce gravitational wave

In theory, you should be able to calculate:
	- Chirp mass
	- X_eff, X_p
	- Eta
	- Tidal parameters
	- Luminosity distance to redshift
	- Time to merger
	- # of mergers
	- Multiple detector PSDs
	- Spin precession/evolution
	- SNR (will need waveforms for this)
	- Given sensitivity, how many black holes in certain amount of time
		- Factor in uncertainty of rates
	- Data from Arxiv entry: 1304 0670
		- Calculate SNR, get other quantities from that
